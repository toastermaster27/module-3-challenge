# Password Generator Starter Code

As a developer, I want to generate a random password when "Generate Password" is clicked.

The user should be prompted with a series of the following questions:
- How long do you want your password?
- Do you want to include capital letters?
- Do you want to include lower-case letters?
- Do you want to include special characters?
- Do you want to include numbers?

After questions are answered, a password should be generated using the criteria selected by the user.
